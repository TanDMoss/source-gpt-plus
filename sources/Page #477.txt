Launch Lab: Inside Story

Different species of animals have evolved various reproductive strategies. For instance, in late fall, a female salmon lays hundreds to thousands of eggs in the gravel bed of a stream. At the same time, the male releases millions of sperm over the eggs. The fertilized eggs develop through the winter, and the hatchlings emerge in the spring.

Procedure:

1.In small groups, create a list of the main features of salmon reproductive strategies and compare them to human reproduction. Use a table or a graphic organizer to organize your ideas.
2. Based on the comparison, predict the differences in the reproductive organs of salmon and humans. Record your ideas in a chart or a table.
Analysis:

1. What are the adaptive advantages and disadvantages of having a reproductive strategy in which fertilization and fetal development take place within the female body?
2. Do you think a male salmon has a penis? Why or why not?
3. Do you think a female salmon has a uterus? Why or why not?
4. Compare human sperm and egg. What are the adaptive advantages of the differences between them?

Additionally, Pioneers 10 and 11 are two space probes carrying a plaque into deep space, waiting for possible discovery by intelligent beings from another planet. Many people on Earth were concerned that human sexual characteristics were displayed so prominently. Discuss why human sexuality and reproduction are sensitive topics. )
