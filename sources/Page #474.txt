Unit 6 Preparation: Endocrine System

-To prepare for this unit, you should have a good understanding of the endocrine system. Table P6.1 provides an overview of the principal endocrine glands and some of their hormones. The endocrine system consists of glands and tissues that secrete hormones, which are chemical signals that affect the activity of other glands or tissues in the body. The endocrine system plays a prominent role in the development of reproductive organs as well as the development of new human life.

-Table P6.1: Principal Glands of the Endocrine System and Some of their Hormones. This table provides an overview of the principal glands of the endocrine system and some of their hormones. The endocrine system interacts with the nervous system to regulate the activities of other body systems and to maintain homeostasis.

--Hypothalamus: secretes hypothalamic releasing- and inhibiting-hormones that regulate anterior pituitary hormones such as human growth hormone (hGH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).

--Anterior pituitary: secretes human growth hormone (hGH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).

--Posterior pituitary: secretes antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin (OCT).

--Thyroid gland: secretes thyroxine (T4) and calcitonin.

--Parathyroid gland: secretes parathyroid hormone (PTH).

--Adrenal cortex: secretes glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone), and gonadocorticoids.

--Adrenal medulla: secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine.

--Pancreas: secretes insulin and glucagon.

--Ovaries: secrete estrogen and progesterone.

--Testes: secrete testosterone.

-Understanding the roles of these hormones and glands is essential for understanding how the endocrine system regulates human reproduction and development. )
