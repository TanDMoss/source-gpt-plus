Section 14.3 Summary: Sex Hormones and Reproduction

• Sex hormones work to stimulate the development of male and female reproductive systems and regulate the function of the mature reproductive system.
• In males, the main sex hormone is testosterone. In females, the main sex hormones are estrogen and progesterone.
• In addition to their effect on the reproductive system, the sex hormones act throughout the body to cause the development of secondary sex characteristics.
• In the male reproductive system, a negative feedback hormone system maintains a relatively constant level of sperm production and testosterone.
• In females, hormone systems interact to regulate a monthly menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle combines events in the ovary and in the uterus to maximize the chance of a zygote successfully implanting in the uterus for development into a fetus.

Thought Lab 14.4 Therapy Options for Menopause

For many years, doctors in North America routinely prescribed estrogen, or a combination of estrogen and progesterone, to help alleviate the symptoms of menopause. In 2000, the U.S.-based National Institutes of Health began a detailed investigation of the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Researchers stopped the study several years early, however, when they found that HRT was associated with a significant increase in the risk of strokes, heart disease, and breast cancer among their test subjects. The findings led scientists to look for a safer alternative to HRT.

• Human babies are born with complete but immature reproductive systems. At puberty, an increase in production of GnRH by the hypothalamus stimulates the release of FSH and LH in the anterior pituitary. These hormones, in turn, trigger the development of gametes and the release of sex hormones.
• Hormone replacement therapy has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, and blood clots, an increased risk of breast cancer and colorectal cancer, and an increased risk of dementia.
• For this reason, Health Canada advises that a woman should not begin hormone replacement therapy without a thorough medical evaluation and a careful assessment of her own particular needs, health, and medical history. In some cases, the benefits of the therapy may outweigh the risks. In other cases, the reverse is true. Scientists continue to search for other ways to alleviate the symptoms and long-term health effects of menopause.

Analysis Procedure:

Using print or Internet resources, research two or three different kinds of therapies available to women who want to alleviate the symptoms of menopause.
For each of the therapies you are studying, gather information about how the treatment affects cells and tissues in the body, how the treatment affects hormone feedback systems, and any known health risks and benefits.
Organize the information you have gathered. Create a short report or presentation to summarize and communicate your findings.
Based on your research, is it possible to claim that one of these therapies is better than the others? What, if anything, should health practitioners and pharmaceutical companies have done differently?
