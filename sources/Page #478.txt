The human reproductive system is designed to unite a single reproductive cell from a female parent with a single reproductive cell from a male parent. The male and female reproductive systems have very different structures and functions but also share many features. Both systems include a pair of gonads (testes and ovaries) that produce reproductive cells, or gametes. The gonads also produce sex hormones that control the development and function of the reproductive system.

The human reproductive system includes internal and external sex organs, ducts, and glands that play a role in forming and transporting gametes. The structures that play a direct role in reproduction are called primary sex characteristics, while features that are not directly related to reproductive function are called secondary sex characteristics.

The male reproductive system produces and stores large numbers of sperm cells. The testes, located in the scrotum, produce sperm in a network of seminiferous tubules with the help of Sertoli cells. The sperm travel to the epididymis, where they mature and are stored until ejaculation. During ejaculation, sperm travel through the ductus deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the urethra to exit the body through the penis. Along the way, the sperm are mixed with fluids from the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and Cowper’s gland to form semen.

The female reproductive system produces and releases eggs, or ova, which are fertilized by sperm to form a zygote. The ovaries are responsible for producing eggs and female sex hormones. The eggs are released from the ovaries into the fimbriae, hair-like structures that guide the egg into the oviduct. The egg may be fertilized by sperm in the oviduct, and if fertilization occurs, the resulting zygote travels to the uterus where it implants in the endometrium. If fertilization does not occur, the endometrium is shed during menstruation. The cervix, which connects the uterus to the vagina, helps protect the uterus and allows for the passage of sperm during intercourse. The vulva includes the external structures of the female reproductive system, including the labia and clitoris.
