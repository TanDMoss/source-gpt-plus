The Ovarian Cycle

The ovary contains cellular structures called follicles. Each follicle contains a single immature ovum.
During a single ovarian cycle, one follicle matures, releases an ovum, and then develops into a yellowish, gland-like structure known as a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then degenerates.
The term corpus luteum comes from two Latin words that mean “yellow body.” The term follicle comes from a Latin word that means “small.”
The Uterine Cycle

The uterus prepares for the arrival of a fertilized ovum in a series of cyclic events known as the uterine cycle.
Both the ovarian and uterine cycles are controlled by the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which are produced by the ovaries.
Figure 14.14

A follicle matures by growing layers of follicular cells and a central fluid-filled vesicle. The vesicle contains the maturing ovum.
At ovulation, the follicle ruptures, and the ovum is released into the oviduct.
The follicle develops into a corpus luteum.
If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum starts to degenerate after about 10 days.
Note that the follicle does not migrate around the ovary, as shown here for clarity, but goes through all the stages in one place.
Figure 14.15

The hypothalamus produces GnRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce FSH and LH.
FSH stimulates the follicle to produce estrogen.
LH stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone.
Developing follicles produce estrogen and some progesterone.
Ovulation: mature follicle releases ovum.
The corpus luteum produces progesterone and some estrogen.
The arrows in the figure can be labeled with plus signs (+) and negative signs (–) to show which hormones have a stimulating action and which have an inhibitory action.
