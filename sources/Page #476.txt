Chapter Concepts
14.1 The Male and Female Reproductive Systems

The male and female reproductive systems have features in common as well as features that distinguish one from the other.
The reproductive cells (gametes) in males are sperm and in females are eggs (ova).
14.2 The Effect of Sexually Transmitted Infections on the Reproductive Systems

Sexually transmitted infections may be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria and viruses.
Sexually transmitted infections can harm the health of individuals as well as interfere with the proper functioning of egg and sperm cells.
14.3 Hormonal Regulation of the Reproductive Systems

Hormonal as well as genetic (chromosomal) factors affect the formation of the gonads and reproductive organs during prenatal (pre-birth) development.
Sex hormones help in the maintenance and function of male and female reproductive systems.
Contact between sperm and egg is the central event of human reproduction. At that moment, reproductive processes in two different individuals join together to create the single cell that will develop over a period of nine months into a new human being. While most mammals can produce more young than humans can, humans are among the few species able to mate and produce young at any time of year. This ability helps to make human populations very mobile and adaptable to new surroundings. In association with our intelligence and technological capabilities, the ability to conceive at any time is one of the factors that has enabled our species to establish our populations almost everywhere on Earth and even to seek and create environments for ourselves beyond the confines of our planet.)
