The Menstrual Cycle

The menstrual cycles of individual women differ widely in their length and timing. When women live together, however, their menstrual cycles tend to synchronize. The significance of the menstrual cycle is for the preparation of the female reproductive system for pregnancy.

The Ovarian Cycle
The ovarian cycle has two stages: the follicular phase and the luteal phase.

Follicular phase: The follicle in the ovary matures and releases estrogen into the bloodstream, which stimulates the thickening of the endometrium.
Luteal phase: The ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone that further thickens the endometrium.
The Function of Corpus Luteum
The corpus luteum produces progesterone that thickens the endometrium.

The Uterine Cycle
The uterine cycle is closely linked to the ovarian cycle. Ovulation takes place about halfway through the ovarian cycle, around day 14. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg completes the passage through the oviduct and arrives at the uterus a few days later. The timing of the uterine cycle ensures that the uterus is prepared to receive and nurture a new life. The events of the uterine cycle cause a build-up of blood vessels and tissues in the endometrium. If fertilization does not occur, the endometrium disintegrates and menstruation begins.

The uterine cycle begins on the first day of menstruation (which is also the first day of the ovarian cycle). The estrogen level in the blood gradually increases, causing the endometrium to begin thickening. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone, causing a more rapid thickening of the endometrium. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, the endometrium breaks down, and menstruation begins again.

Difference Between the Uterine Cycle and the Ovarian Cycle
The ovarian cycle takes place in the ovary and involves the maturation of the follicle and the release of the ovum, while the uterine cycle takes place in the uterus and involves the thickening of the endometrium and the shedding of the endometrial lining during menstruation.

Aging and the Menstrual Cycle
The number of functioning follicles in the female reproductive system decreases with age, leading to a gradual overall decline in the amount of estrogen and progesterone in the blood. Menopause is the end of the menstrual cycle, which usually occurs around the age of 50 in North American women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a prescription of low levels of estrogen with or without progesterone that can ease some menopause symptoms, but it is associated with risks such as increased risk of uterine cancer, breast cancer, and heart disease.
