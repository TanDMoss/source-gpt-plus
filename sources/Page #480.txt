Table 14.1 Primary and Secondary Sex Characteristics

Sex Primary sex characteristics
male • gonads (testes) • penis
• scrotum • seminal vesicles
• epididymis • prostate gland
• ductus deferens • Cowper’s gland
female • gonads (ovaries) • cervix
• oviducts • vagina
• uterus • vulva

Selected secondary sex characteristics (with wide variations among individuals and ethnic groups)
• facial hair • body hair
• deeper voice, broader shoulders, narrower hips, and more obvious muscle development compared with female
• minimal facial hair • minimal body hair
• prominent breasts (compared with male)
• higher voice, more rounded shoulders, wider hips, and less obvious muscle development compared with male

BiologyFile FYI
The term gonad comes from a Greek word that means “procreation.” The term gamete comes from a Greek word that means “marriage,” referring to the union of a sperm and an egg.

About 3 percent of all baby boys are born with testes that have not descended properly. This condition can be corrected surgically.

Figure 14.2 Structures of the male reproductive system. Sperm originate in the testes and leave the male body through the penis. The testes and the penis are located outside the body, while most of the other sexual structures are located inside the body.

The male reproductive system includes structures that produce sperm cells (also known as gametes) and organs that help to deposit these sperm cells within the female reproductive tract. Some of the male reproductive structures are located outside the body, and others are located inside the body. Figure 14.2 shows the male reproductive system. Refer to this figure as you read through the following paragraphs. Table 14.2, on page 481, summarizes the functions of the male reproductive organs.

The Testes

The two male gonads are called the testes. The testes are held outside the body in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The scrotum regulates the temperature of the testes. Spermproduction is most successful at temperatures around 35 °C— that is, a few degrees cooler than normal body temperature. In cold conditions, the scrotum draws close to the body, so the testicles stay warm. In hot conditions, the scrotum holds the testicles more loosely, allowing them to remain cooler than the body.

As shown in Figure 14.3, the testes are composed of long, coiled tubes, called seminiferous tubules, as well as hormone-secreting cells, called interstitial cells, that lie between the seminiferous tubules. The interstitial cells secrete the male hormone testosterone. The seminiferous tubules are where sperm cells are produced through the process of spermatogenesis.

The Epididymis and Ductus Deferens

After sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules, they are passed into a network of coiled tubes called the epididymis, where they mature and become motile. From the epididymis, sperm travel through the ductus deferens, which is a muscular tube that can propel sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.

Accessory Glands

Several accessory glands contribute secretions to the semen, which is the fluid that carries sperm out of the body during ejaculation. These accessory glands include the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and Cowper’s gland. The seminal vesicles secrete a fluid that is rich in fructose, which provides energy for the sperm. The prostate gland secretes a thin, milky fluid that contains enzymes and nutrients. The Cowper’s gland secretes a clear, slippery fluid that neutralizes any acidity that may be present in the urethra.

The Penis

The penis is the male organ that is used for sexual intercourse. The penis contains three erectile tissues that fill with blood during sexual arousal, causing the penis to become erect. At the tip of the penis is the urethral meatus, which is the opening through which semen and urine exit the body. During ejaculation, semen is expelled from the penis through the urethra.

The Male Reproductive System

The male reproductive system is responsible for producing and delivering sperm cells to the female reproductive tract. Sperm cells are the male reproductive cells that combine with a female’s egg cell to form a zygote, which develops into an embryo and eventually a fetus.

In addition to the production and delivery of sperm cells, the male reproductive system also produces and secretes hormones that are responsible for male sexual development and secondary sex characteristics. The primary male sex hormone is testosterone, which is produced by the testes. Testosterone is responsible for the development of male secondary sex characteristics, such as facial and body hair, deeper voice, and muscle development.

Understanding the male reproductive system is essential for understanding human reproduction and development. It is also important for understanding common male reproductive disorders, such as erectile dysfunction, infertility, and prostate cancer.)
